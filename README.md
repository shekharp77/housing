## General Information
- This is a ML project that contains a Jupyter notebook where we did data analysis and created a model.
- You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
- They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.



## Conclusions
Below are the things thats affects the housing prices most
